## Theory: What is LDA and Why is it Useful?

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** used for **topic modeling** â€” that means it helps find the main themes or topics inside a large set of documents or text, without knowing them in advance.

### Simple Explanation (Layman Style):

Imagine you have 1000 articles (documents), and you want to know **what are the common topics** across them.

Instead of reading each one manually, LDA does this:

* It assumes every document is made up of  **multiple topics** .
* Each topic is made of  **multiple keywords** .
* Then, it reverse-engineers the documents to **discover hidden (latent) topics** based on word patterns.

For example, a news article about cricket might be:

* 70% Sports
* 20% Politics
* 10% Business

LDA figures that out automatically by observing which words co-occur frequently.

### How LDA Works (High-level View)

LDA assumes a **generative process** for how documents are written:

1. Pick a mixture of topics for a document (e.g., 60% sports, 40% tech).
2. For each word in the document:
   * Choose a topic from that mixture.
   * Pick a word from that topicâ€™s word distribution.

LDA tries to  **reverse this process** , starting from words â†’ topics â†’ documents.

It uses probability and something called the **Dirichlet distribution** to do this mathematically.

### Technical Keywords (Simplified)

* **Topics** = groups of words that go together (like `['ball', 'bat', 'match', 'wicket']`)
* **Documents** = collection of words (e.g., article, review)
* **Corpus** = full collection of documents
* **Unsupervised Learning** = no labels or predefined answers
* **Dirichlet Distribution** = a way to model probability over multiple categories

### Why is LDA Useful?

* Summarize huge collections of documents
* Group similar articles (clustering)
* Build recommender systems (based on content)
* Discover hidden themes in customer feedback
* Analyze research papers, news, blogs in minutes
